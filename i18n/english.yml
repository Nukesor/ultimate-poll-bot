    limited_help: |
      Every user gets a fixed number of votes they can distribute, but only once per option.
      Pretty much like block vote, but people need to prioritize.
      This mode is good for limiting the amount of possible winners e.g. if you only want max 4 games on your LAN-Party.
    cumulative_help: |
      Every user gets a fixed number of votes they can distribute as they like (even multiple votes per option).
      This mode has a little more depth than limited vote, since it allows users to vote on a single option multiple times.
    unlimited_help: |
      Every user can vote as often on any option as they want.
      This is great if you want to, for instance, determine how much stuff everyone wants for the next festival trip.

    Hello there!

    My name is Arne Beer (@Nukesor). I'm the sole developer of the Ultimate PollBot.

    The idea of writing the Ultimate PollBot was formed, when my friends couldn't decide again where we should go for lunch.
    This happened so many times already and we desperately needed a good and stable solution inside of telegram for this problem!
    That's how the ULTIMATE PollBot was born.

    Every line of code in this project was written in my leisure time and is completely for free.
    This project is non-profit, open-source on [Github](https://github.com/Nukesor/ultimate-poll-bot) and hosted on a server I'm renting from my own money.

    Right now I usually invest between 2-10 hours a week into developing and maintaining my projects and I would love to get some support, since I'm doing this in a large part for you out there.

    I really appreciate anything that helps me out and that keeps my server and me running ☺️.

    If you have any questions, stop by my [support group](https://t.me/nukesors_projects).
    If you like this project, check my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/nukesor) or support me via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.me/arnebeer).

    Have great day!

    *Hi!*

    This is the *ULTIMATE* PollBot.
    Just type /create or click the button below to start creating polls. Everything is explained underway.

    You can change the language with /language.
    If you have more questions, check out /help.

    If you like the project, stop by my [support group](https://t.me/nukesors_projects).
    This project is open-source on [Github](https://github.com/Nukesor/ultimate-poll-bot).

    There are quite a few settings for your polls:

    🌟*Creation:*
    1. You can anonymize your poll, which results in no names being displayed!
    2. Poll results can be shown only after closing the poll. This is great to avoid tactical voting, which is possible if people can see the intermediate results of a poll.

    ⚙️ *Settings:*
    1. A poll can be made anonymous retrospectively.
    2. The percentage line of options can be hidden in the settings menu.
    3. New options can be added and existing options can be removed in the settings menu.
    4. You can allow other users to add options to your poll.
    5. The order in which user names and options are displayed in the results can be changed.

    📣 *Notifications:*
    If you enable notifications for your chat, the bot will send a message 1 day, 6 hours, and 1 hour before the poll closes.
    This is just a feature to remind everyone in a group that a poll will close soon, and to make it easy to find the poll message again 😉.

    To enable notifications in a chat follow these steps:
    1. Create a poll
    2. Set a due date in the settings menu
    3. Go to the chat you want to be notified (The pollbot needs added to the group)
    4. Reply with /notify to the poll message you selected via @ultimate\_pollbot
    5. Pick the correct poll

    This whole procedure is unhappily overly complicated, since telegram doesn't allow to detect messages from bots in groups 😐.
    Thereby we don't know which poll is posted in which group and everything needs to be done manually.

    🕰 *Find old polls:*
    There are two commands /list and /list\_closed, which allow you to find and manage your old polls.

    ⚠️ *Delete polls:*
    You can delete individual polls in the respective poll menus.
    There's also the /delete\_closed command, which deletes all closed polls
    and the /delete\_all command which deletes ALL polls.

    🌐 *Language:*
    Ultimate pollbot supports multiple languages, but only English is officially maintained.
    To add a new language, go to the Github repository, copy the `english.yml`, rename it to your language and adjust all values.
    Be careful to not fuck up any Markdown styling (`**`, `__`, `${}`), otherwise stuff will break for your language.
    If anything breaks, because of broken translations, please fix it on your own. I will not investigate these issues.
    The multi language support is a community driven feature I happily support, but I cannot support multiple languages on my own.

    ⚠️ *There is a bug that won't go away!!* 😩
    I usually get a notification as soon as something breaks, but there might be some bugs that go unnoticed!
    In case a bug isn't fixed in a day or two, please write a ticket on [Github](https://github.com/Nukesor/ultimate-poll-bot) or stop by my [support group](https://t.me/nukesors_projects).

  error: |
    An unknown error occurred. I probably just got a notification about this and I'll try to fix it as quickly as possible.
    In case the bug isn't fixed in a day or two, please write a ticket on [Github](https://github.com/Nukesor/ultimate-poll-bot) or stop by my [support group](https://t.me/nukesors_projects).
