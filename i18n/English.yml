  poll_type_help: |
    Current poll type: *%{poll_type}*

    👍 *Single Vote:*
    Every user gets a single vote. The default and normal voting mode.

    📅 *Doodle:*
    Users can vote for `yes`, `no`, or `maybe` for each option. Great for finding a date.

    ↕ *Priority Vote*:
    Every user ranks the options by preference. Options get points depending on their place in the ranking.
    This helps to find good compromises, i.e. options that most people prefer over other options.
    For instance, the Eurovision Song Contest chooses their winner with a form of priority voting.

    🛒 *Unlimited Votes* (or the shopping list 😎):
    Every user can vote as often on any option as they want.
    This is great if you want to, for instance, determine how much stuff everyone wants for the next festival trip.

    🎮 *Block Vote:*
    Every user can vote for all (or less) options. Like a doodle, but you can only vote `yes`.
    Useful for finding the most wanted options in a group, e.g. games that should be played on a LAN-Party.

    🎮 *Limited Vote:*
    Every user gets a fixed number of votes they can distribute, but only once per option.
    Pretty much like block vote, but people need to prioritize.
    This mode is good for limiting the amount of possible winners e.g. if you only want max 4 games on your LAN-Party.

    📊 *Cumulative Vote:*
    Every user gets a fixed number of votes they can distribute as they like (even multiple votes per option).
    This mode has a little more depth than limited vote, since it allows users to vote on a single option multiple times.

    Hello there!

    My name is Arne Beer (@Nukesor). I'm the sole developer of the Ultimate pollbot.

    The idea of writing the Ultimate pollbot was formed, when my friends couldn't decide (again), where we should go for lunch.
    This had already happened way too many times and we desperately needed a good and stable solution inside of telegram for this problem!
    That's how the ULTIMATE pollbot was born.

    Every line of code in this project was written in my leisure time and is completely for free.
    This project is non-profit, open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Nukesor/ultimate-poll-bot) and hosted on a server I'm renting.

    Right now I usually invest between 5-20 hours a week into developing and maintaining my projects and I would love to get some support.
    If it accumulates, I may find more time to maintain and develop my projects. Maybe I even get to try some of my ideas!

    I really appreciate everything that helps me and keeps my server running ☺️.

    If you like this project, check out my [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/nukesor) or [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Nukesor).
    If you have any questions, stop by my [support group](https://t.me/nukesors_projects).

    Have great day!
  start: |
    🌟Welcome to the *ULTIMATE* pollbot 🌟

    Just type /create or click the button below to start creating polls. Everything is explained underway.

    🌐 You can pick another language under settings 🌐
    ❓Click help for more explanations ❓

    If you like the project, stop by my [support group](https://t.me/nukesors_projects) or check out my [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/nukesor).
    This bot is open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Nukesor/ultimate-poll-bot).

  start_after_results: Hey! Just type /create to make your own poll ☺️
  over_3000: |
    ⚠️ Your poll is already over *3000 characters* long, please try to keep it short and at least under 3000, or even better under 2500 🙏.

    Telegram enforces a maximum of 4096 characters per messages and I need to display votes on top of your initial text. Every poll with more characters than that *will just stop working*.
    I already try to handle this as good as possible and summarize votes to save space, but there's only so much space.

    For polls with a lot of text and over 10-15 options, you might be better off using an external tool like [Doodle](https://doodle.com/)
  over_4000: |
    ⚠️ Your poll is over *4000 characters* long. This is too long to display it in a single message. Please try to keep it short and under 3000 characters, or even better under 2500 🙏.

    Telegram enforces a maximum of 4096 characters per messages and I need to display votes on top of your initial text. Every poll with more characters than that *will just stop working*.
    I already try to handle this as good as possible, but my hands are tied with this one.

    For really long polls with many options, you are better off using an external tool like [Doodle](https://doodle.com/)
  too_long: |
    Hey!

    I'm very sorry, but your poll is simply too long. You probably got a large number of options or added a very long description text (or both). 😬

    Since Telegram only allows 4096 characters per message, I simply cannot show any polls that are getting longer than this. 😐

    Please try to keep the description and option names short and if you want to use polls with many options, you may be better of using an external tool like [Doodle](https://doodle.com/).

        One way to resolve this problem might be to remove options (the admin can do that).

    👇 You can still vote and see the results below. 👇
  help:
    intro: |
      There are quite a few settings for your polls.
      Just pick the category you're interested in or just read everything 😉.

      In case you just want to create a poll, type /create
    creation: |
      🌟*Creation:*

      To create a new poll, just write or click /create.
      For each poll you can specify several initial settings

      *Poll type:* The various types are explained in detail in the poll type menu.
      *Anonymity:* You can anonymize your poll, which results in no names being displayed! This is permanent and for all parties.
      *Visible results:* In this mode, votes only become visible after closing the poll. This is needed to avoid the possibility of [tactical voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting) and to prevent [Anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring)

      -> *Attention: A closed poll with invisible results stays closed!:*
      Reopening a poll would allow a user, specifically the poll creator, to look at the votes, and place his own vote in a manner, that would result in a possible advantage for him (tactical voting).

    settings: |
      ⚙️ *Settings:*

      Further settings of a poll can be adjusted after the poll has been created:

      *Language:* The language for this specific poll can be changed.
      *Anonymity:* A poll can be made anonymous retrospectively.
      *Due date:* A due date at which the poll will be automatically closed can be set.
      *Options:* New options can be added and existing options can be removed in the settings menu.
      *User Options:* You can allow other users to add options to your poll.

      *---- Styling submenu: ----*

      *Percentage:*
      _The percentage line of options can be hidden in the styling menu._

      *Option votes:*
      _The sum of all votes for an option can be hidden._

      *Summarize votes:*
      _If many people vote on your poll, the message might get crowded. Summarize the votes to have a better overview._

      *Order:*
      _The order in which user names and options are displayed in the results can be changed._

    notifications: |
      📣 *Notifications:*

      If you enable notifications for your chat, the bot will send a message 1 day, 6 hours, and 1 hour before the poll closes.
      This is just a feature to remind everyone in a group that a poll will close soon, and to make it easy to find the poll message again 😉.

      To enable notifications in a chat follow these steps:
      *1.* Create a poll
      *2.* Set a due date in the settings menu
      *3.* Go to the chat you want to be notified
      *4.* Add the pollbot to the group
      *5.* Share the poll to this group
      *6.* Reply with /notify to the poll message you selected via @ultimate\_pollbot
      *7.* Pick the correct poll

      This whole procedure is unhappily overly complicated, since telegram doesn't allow to detect messages from bots in groups 😐.
      Thereby we don't know which poll is posted in which group and everything needs to be done manually.

    management: |
      🕰 *Find old polls:*

      There is an option in your /start menu to find all open polls.
      Closed polls can be listed in the /settings menu.

      ⚠️ *Delete polls:*

      You can delete individual polls in the respective poll menus.
      There are also options delete all polls or all closed polls in the /settings menu.

    languages: |
      🌐 *Language:*

      Ultimate pollbot supports multiple languages, but only English is officially maintained.

      To add a new language, or to update a current language, please contact me @Nukesor!
      I'm using the localization service [Lokalise](https://lokalise.co), which agreed to provide me with an open-source license for translating my projects.
      For this service to work, you'll need to provide me with an email address (any spam mail is enough), since I need to send you an invite via email.

      Please be careful to keep the correct Markdown styling (`**`, `__`, `${}`), otherwise stuff will break for your language.
      If anything breaks, I will try to fix it, but please help me to prevent this. It just takes time and effort to fix such bugs.
      The multi language support is a community driven feature I happily support, but I cannot support multiple languages on my own.

    bugs: |
      ⚠️ *There is an unknown bug that won't go away!!* 😩

      I usually get a notification as soon as something breaks, but there might be some bugs that go unnoticed!
      In case a bug isn't fixed in a day or two, please write a ticket on [GitHub](https://github.com/Nukesor/ultimate-poll-bot) or stop by my [support group](https://t.me/nukesors_projects).

  error: |
    An unknown error occurred. I probably just got a notification about this and I'll try to fix it as quickly as possible.
    In case the bug isn't fixed in a day or two, please write a ticket on [GitHub](https://github.com/Nukesor/ultimate-poll-bot) or stop by my [support group](https://t.me/nukesors_projects).
